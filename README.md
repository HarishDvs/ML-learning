Women Safety Analytics using ML (DeepFace)
Project Overview
This project is designed to enhance women's safety using advanced Machine Learning (ML) models for gender bias detection. It integrates facial recognition, gesture recognition, and audio analysis to monitor environments in real-time and proactively alert in cases of potential danger or abnormal gender ratios. By analyzing video feeds frame-by-frame and detecting certain gestures like SOS signals, this system aims to provide early warnings and help prevent unsafe situations.

Features
Real-Time Gender Bias Detection: Analyze video and audio streams to identify gender imbalances in a scene, particularly in sensitive environments.
Gesture Recognition for SOS Alerts: Detect SOS or similar distress gestures using hand gesture recognition powered by MediaPipe.
Proactive Alerting: Alerts are triggered based on scenarios such as a high male-to-female ratio, sudden increases in male presence, or large group gatherings.
Voice and Gesture Integration: The system integrates multiple modalities (voice, face, gestures) for a comprehensive safety solution.
Privacy-Focused AI: Built with privacy and ethical considerations, this solution processes data securely without retaining unnecessary information.

Key Components
1. Video Analysis
This component breaks down video feeds into frames (or uses webcam streams) and processes each frame to detect the number of men and women using DeepFace.

2. Gender Bias Detection
Using DeepFace, the system determines the gender of individuals in the frame and compares gender ratios. If suspicious patterns (e.g., 4:1 male-to-female ratio) are detected, an alert is generated.

3. Gesture Detection
Powered by MediaPipe, the system analyzes hand gestures to detect SOS or similar distress gestures. If an SOS gesture is detected, the system sends a real-time alert.

4. Alerts
Alerts are generated based on predefined suspicious activity scenarios:

High male-to-female ratio (e.g., 4:1 or higher)
Large group gatherings (more than 10 people in the frame)
Sudden changes in gender counts
SOS gestures detected via hand movement.
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or above
OpenCV
MediaPipe
DeepFace
NumPy
(Optional) Google Colab for running in the cloud
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/women-safety-analytics.git
cd women-safety-analytics
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Program:

Webcam-based Detection: To run the webcam-based detection, simply execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
python src/webcam_analysis.py
Video-based Detection: For video analysis, update the video path in the script and run:

bash
Copy code
python src/video_analysis.py --video /path/to/video.mp4
How It Works
1. Gender Detection:
The DeepFace model analyzes each frame of the video or live feed to detect the gender of each person in the frame. If the male-to-female ratio becomes imbalanced (e.g., 4 men to 1 woman), an alert is triggered.

2. Gesture Recognition:
Using MediaPipe, the system monitors hand gestures in real-time. If an SOS gesture (or similar) is detected, it flags the frame as suspicious.

3. Alerting Mechanism:
If certain conditions are met (e.g., large groups, high male-to-female ratios, SOS gestures), the system triggers an alert to notify users of the potential risk.

Scenarios Detected
High Male-to-Female Ratio: Triggered when the male population in a frame is disproportionally higher than the female population.
Large Groups: Detects gatherings of more than 10 people in a frame.
SOS Gesture: Detects distress signals through hand gestures using MediaPipe.
Sudden Changes in Gender Count: Flags frames where the count of men or women changes drastically from one frame to another.
Customization
You can customize the alert scenarios in gender_bias_detection.py and gesture_detection.py by adjusting the parameters for ratios, group sizes, or specific gesture conditions.

Future Enhancements
Audio Analysis: Integrate speech recognition and voice tone analysis to detect distress calls.
Mobile App Integration: Provide alerts through a mobile app for immediate notifications.
Crowd Density Monitoring: Enhance the system to analyze crowd density in large spaces.
